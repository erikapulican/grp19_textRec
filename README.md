# grp19_textRec

Project description:
Often in Colleges and offices where there is a need to convert text images to documents,
the task is often time consuming and too hectic. it also tends to require a lot of typing work.
In such cases it would be quite useful to cut down the time consumed so that it can be used elsewhere.

this img-to-txt recognition app proves to be quite useful in such cases 

this app consits of a registration page , login page and the main activity page
wherein we use the camera to click an image with text written on it, which is taken as input by the app which
then detects the text from the image itself.
